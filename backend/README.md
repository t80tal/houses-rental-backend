Hey everyone,

Hope you will find my FastApi project helpful!
I used popular modules in this project you can find them all in ./requirements.txt
and easily install them by typing the following commands(in your terminal/cmd, In the project directory):

If your virtual enviorment name is "venv":

.\venv\Scripts\activate

cd backend

pip install -r ./requirements.txt

to run the server you need to stay in "backend" directory and type:

uvicorn main:app --reload
